// ─── Task stage rollup ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Task.stage is a materialized rollup of all ChannelThread statuses for that task.
// Call recomputeTaskStage() after ANY thread status or providerState change.
// It respects manualStage (set by the recruiter for INTERVIEW / HIRED / REJECTED).
//
// P1 #16 / #17 — the function returns a typed event contract
// `{ stage, changed, fromStage, source }` so future downstream consumers
// (Slack notifications, ATS sync, analytics) can subscribe to a single
// event source and dedupe naturally instead of double-firing on
// system-rollup-after-manual. Source identifies who triggered the
// recompute. Pass `source` from the caller (defaults to SYSTEM); manual
// recruiter routes pass MANUAL, webhook handlers pass WEBHOOK.
